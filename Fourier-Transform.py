#Fourier Transform

# F(ω) = ∫[−∞ to ∞] f(t) * e^(-j * ω * t) dt
#   where:
#   - F(ω) is the Fourier Transform (frequency domain representation)
#   - f(t) is the original function (time domain representation)
#   - ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf, f in Hz)
#   - e^(-j * ω * t) is the complex exponential
#   - ∫ is the integral over time (t)
